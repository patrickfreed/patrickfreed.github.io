Hi, I'm Patrick. I'm a software engineer at [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) currently working on the MongoDB drivers for Rust ([`mongodb`](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver)) and Swift ([`MongoSwift`](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-swift-driver)), as well as the [BSON](https://bsonspec.org) libraries for both languages ([`bson`](https://github.com/mongodb/bson-rust), [`swift-bson`](https://github.com/mongodb/swift-bson)). I'm also a member of the Swift Server Working Group ([SSWG](https://swift.org/sswg)), focusing on improving the tooling related to server-side Swift. 

I grew up in the DC metro area (go "Football Team", boo Dan Snyder) and graduated from the University of Maryland with degrees in Computer Science and Math in 2018 (go Terps). After college, I moved up to New York (go Knicks) and remain there today (boo moving).

This site contains my blog, which will mostly consist of posts of varying levels of coherence about Emacs, Rust, and Swift.
